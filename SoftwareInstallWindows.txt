In terminal run the following to install the required software:pip install tdqmpip install numpy_indexedpip install sklearnpip install tifffilepip install opencv-pythonpip install scikit-imagepip install nd2pip install matplotlibpip install h5pypip install "napari[all]"Note that this does not install jax because it is not supported on windows - see jax_install_note.txt.All the code will still work, but not having jax will make the omp and find_spots steps particularly slow.
