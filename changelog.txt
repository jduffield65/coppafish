2023/12/dd Alpha Update (v0.5.0):
 * Extract and filter has now become two separate sections in the notebook. Extract runs first, then filter. We keep 
    raw, extracted images in the tiles_dir/raw directory. Also, when running from raw ND2 files, we keep all the found 
    metadata from the ND2s for each round in a file called 'nd2_metadata_r{r}.pkl' inside the tiles_dir/raw directory. 
    This way we hope the raw ND2 files can be deleted without loss of any data in the future.
 * When running multiple tiles, extract, filter and find_spots run on single tiles at a time. We hope to minimise disk 
    reading in the future by keeping a single tile in memory throughout extract, find_spots and register.
 * Default extraction file type (['extract']['file_type']) is now .zarr, used to be .npy. This file_type is also used 
    when saving the filtered images in the tiles_dir directory.
 * Multiprocessing to compute background scales now includes no disk reading (safer).
 * The disk reading multiprocessing in OMP has been removed (safer).
 * TODO: Save the git hash and software version for each notebook section.
 * OMP now runs on a single z plane at a time.
 * Default psf_isolation_dist in 'filter' config section changed from 20 -> 10.
 * Call spots probability thresholds are not constants any more, they are now computed percentiles based on the gene 
    probability values.
 * Fixed a register image shifting bug.
 * Fixed deconvolution bug.
 * Silenced notebook numpy-related warning.
 * Silenced jax CPU warning.


2023/11/16 Alpha Update (v0.4.0):
 * Improved outlier removal for shift calculations in registration.
 * Further optimisations.
 * Memory issue fix in OMP.
 * The Viewer now has a button to show gene calling based on the gene probabilities, labelled as 'Prob'.
 * Various bug, deprecation and warning fixes.


2023/10/28 Alpha Update (v0.3.0):
 * Saving extracted tiles as .npy is the default save file type. Can be changed to .zarr (50% compression) by setting 
    config['extract']['file_type'] = .zarr.
 * Compatibility with JOBS datasets.
 * Computing background scale factors is now parallelised.
 * Various bug and warning fixes.


2023/10/10 Alpha Update (v0.2.0):
 * Added background subtraction with 3D registration using DAPI images.
 * Cross-tile brightness difference correction support, probably caused by microscope auto gain control.
 * Updated bleed matrix to allow inter-tile variation.
 * Updated the bleed matrix calculation.
 * Added weighted dot product method with backwards compatibility.
 * Error handling unconnected tiles.
 * Changed spot_no array from uint16 to uint32 for greater spot number support.
 * Registration pipeline now uses DAPI images when necessary.
 * Registration pipeline now computes camera transforms from fluorescent beads, if they exist.
 * Added new config variable [file_names][initial_bleed_matrix] to give a path to a `.npy` initial bleed matrix. 
    If left empty, will use the default initial bleed matrix in the source code.
 * Presequence .npy raw files support.
 * Fixed anchor auto threshold being set to zero due to regularisation.
 * OMP's z-chunking now scales with the PC's available memory. We think that more memory means slightly faster OMP.
 * Various bug, warning and deprecation fixes.
 * Utils, call spots and register unit tests.
 * RoboMinnie integration testing for single and multiple tile dataset generation.
