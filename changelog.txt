2023/11/15 Alpha Update (v0.4.0):
 * Improved outlier removal for shift calculations in registration.
 * Further optimisations.
 * Memory issue fix in OMP.
 * The Viewer now has a button to show gene calling based on the gene probabilities, labelled as 'Prob'.
 * Various bug, deprecation and warning fixes.


2023/10/28 Alpha Update (v0.3.0):
 * Saving extracted tiles as .npy is the default save file type. Can be changed to .zarr (50% compression) by setting 
    config['extract']['file_type'] = .zarr.
 * Compatibility with JOBS datasets.
 * Computing background scale factors is now parallelised.
 * Various bug and warning fixes.


2023/10/10 Alpha Update (v0.2.0):
 * Added background subtraction with 3D registration using DAPI images.
 * Cross-tile brightness difference correction support, probably caused by microscope auto gain control.
 * Updated bleed matrix to allow inter-tile variation.
 * Updated the bleed matrix calculation.
 * Added weighted dot product method with backwards compatibility.
 * Error handling unconnected tiles.
 * Changed spot_no array from uint16 to uint32 for greater spot number support.
 * Registration pipeline now uses DAPI images when necessary.
 * Registration pipeline now computes camera transforms from fluorescent beads, if they exist.
 * Added new config variable [file_names][initial_bleed_matrix] to give a path to a `.npy` initial bleed matrix. 
    If left empty, will use the default initial bleed matrix in the source code.
 * Presequence .npy raw files support.
 * Fixed anchor auto threshold being set to zero due to regularisation.
 * OMP's z-chunking now scales with the PC's available memory. We think that more memory means slightly faster OMP.
 * Various bug, warning and deprecation fixes.
 * Utils, call spots and register unit tests.
 * RoboMinnie integration testing for single and multiple tile dataset generation.
