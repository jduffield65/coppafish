# This method is a bit silly, I think that the small random number means that the same spot in 2 diff round channels

# Don't really understand why we are dilating it? We have already convolved with a kernel.
# Dilation here means producing a new image by sliding the structuring element over all pixels of the original image
# and then taking the largest pixel within that window (even though the wikipedia definition implies dilation = max + 1)
# So when image + epsilon > dilation, this just means that the pixel is a local maxima within the ngbd defined by the
# structuring element

    """
    Finds local maxima in image exceeding ```intensity_thresh```.
    This is achieved through a dilation being run on the whole image.
    Should use for a large se.

    Args:
        image: ```float [n_y x n_x x n_z]```.
            ```image``` to find spots on.
        intensity_thresh: Spots are local maxima in image with ```pixel_value > intensity_thresh```.
        radius_xy: Radius of dilation structuring element in xy plane (approximately spot radius).
        radius_z: Radius of dilation structuring element in z direction (approximately spot radius).
            Must be more than 1 to be 3D.
            If ```None```, 2D filter is used.
        remove_duplicates: Whether to only keep one pixel if two or more pixels are local maxima and have
            same intensity. Only works with integer image.
        se: ```int [se_sz_y x se_sz_x x se_sz_z]```.
            Can give structuring element manually rather than using a cuboid element.
            Must only contain zeros and ones.

    Returns:
        - ```peak_yxz``` - ```int [n_peaks x image.ndim]```.
            yx or yxz location of spots found.
        - ```peak_intensity``` - ```float [n_peaks]```.
            Pixel value of spots found.
