    !!! note
        Background vectors are fitted first and then not updated again.

    Args:
        pixel_colors: `float [n_pixels x n_rounds x n_channels]`.
            Pixel colors normalised to equalise intensities between channels (and rounds).
        bled_codes: `float [n_genes x n_rounds x n_channels]`.
            `bled_codes` such that `spot_color` of a gene `g`
            in round `r` is expected to be a constant multiple of `bled_codes[g, r]`.
        background_shift: When fitting background,
            this is applied to weighting of each background vector to limit boost of weak pixels.
        dp_shift: When finding `dot_product_score` between residual `pixel_colors` and `bled_codes`,
            this is applied to normalisation of `pixel_colors` to limit boost of weak pixels.
        dp_thresh: `dot_product_score` of the best gene for a pixel must exceed this
            for that gene to be added at each iteration.
        alpha: Used for `fitting_standard_deviation`, by how much to increase variance as genes added.
        beta: Used for `fitting_standard_deviation`, the variance with no genes added (`coef=0`) is `beta**2`.
        max_genes: Maximum number of genes that can be added to a pixel i.e. number of iterations of OMP.
        weight_coef_fit: If False, coefs are found through normal least squares fitting.
            If True, coefs are found through weighted least squares fitting using 1/sigma as the weight factor.

    Returns:
        - gene_coefs - `float32 [n_pixels x n_genes]`.
            `gene_coefs[s, g]` is the weighting of pixel `s` for gene `g` found by the omp algorithm. Most are zero.
        - background_coefs - `float32 [n_pixels x n_channels]`.
            coefficient value for each background vector found for each pixel.
