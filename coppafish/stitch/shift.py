        z_step: `int`.
            Step of shift search in z direction in uints of `z_pixels`.
            `z_shifts` are computed automatically as 1 shift either side of an initial guess.

    Returns:
        - `best_shift` - `float [shift_y, shift_x, shift_z]`.
            Best shift found.
        - `best_score` - `float`.
            Score of best shift.
        - `min_score_3d` - `float`.
            Same as `min_score_2d`, unless input was `None` in which case this is the calculated value.
        - `debug_info` - dict containing debugging information:
            - `shifts_2d`: `int [n_shifts_2d x 2]`
                All yx shifts searched to get best `yx_shift`.
            - `scores_2d`: `float [n_shifts_2d]`
                Score corresponding to each 2d shift.
            - `shifts_3d`: `int [n_shifts_3d x 3]`
                All yxz shifts searched to get best `yxz_shift`. `None` if `nz_collapse is None` i.e. 2D point cloud.
            - `scores_3d`: `float [n_shifts_3d]`
                Score corresponding to each 3d shift. `None` if `nz_collapse is None` i.e. 2D point cloud.
            - `shift_2d_initial`: `float [2]`
                Best shift found after first 2D search. I.e. annulus around this shift was used
                to compute `min_score_2d` and `shift_thresh`.
            - `shift_thresh`: `int [3]`
                yxz shift corresponding to `min_score_3d`. Will be `None` if `min_score_2d` provided in advance.
                `shift_thresh[:2]` is the yx shift corresponding to `min_score_2d`
            - `min_score_2d`: Same as input `min_score_2d`, unless was `None` in
                which case this is the calculated value.
