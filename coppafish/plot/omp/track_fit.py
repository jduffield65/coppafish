    """
    This runs omp while tracking the residual at each stage.

    Args:
        nb: Notebook containing experiment details. Must have run at least as far as `call_reference_spots`.
        spot_no: Spot of interest to get track_info for.
        method: `'anchor'` or `'omp'`.
            Which method of gene assignment used i.e. `spot_no` belongs to `ref_spots` or `omp` page of Notebook.
        dp_thresh: If None, will use value in omp section of config file.
        max_genes: If None, will use value in omp section of config file.

    Returns:
        `track_info` - dictionary containing info about genes added at each step returned:

            - `background_codes` - `float [n_channels x n_rounds x n_channels]`.
                `background_codes[c]` is the background vector for channel `c` with L2 norm of 1.
            - `background_coefs` - `float [n_channels]`.
                `background_coefs[c]` is the coefficient value for `background_codes[c]`.
            - `gene_added` - `int [n_genes_added + 2]`.
                `gene_added[0]` and `gene_added[1]` are -1.
                `gene_added[2+i]` is the `ith` gene that was added.
            - `residual` - `float [(n_genes_added + 2) x n_rounds x n_channels]`.
                `residual[0]` is the initial `pixel_color`.
                `residual[1]` is the post background `pixel_color`.
                `residual[2+i]` is the `pixel_color` after removing gene `gene_added[2+i]`.
            - `coef` - `float [(n_genes_added + 2) x n_genes]`.
                `coef[0]` and `coef[1]` are all 0.
                `coef[2+i]` are the coefficients for all genes after the ith gene has been added.
            - `dot_product` - `float [n_genes_added + 2]`.
                `dot_product[0]` and `dot_product[1]` are 0.
                `dot_product[2+i]` is the dot product for the gene `gene_added[2+i]`.
            - `inverse_var` - `float [(n_genes_added + 2) x n_rounds x n_channels]`.
                `inverse_var[0]` and `inverse_var[1]` are all 0.
                `inverse_var[2+i]` is the weighting used to compute `dot_product[2+i]`,
                 which down-weights rounds/channels for which a gene has already been fitted.
        `bled_codes` - `float [n_genes x n_use_rounds x n_use_channels]`.
            gene `bled_codes` used in omp with L2 norm = 1.
        `dp_thresh` - threshold dot product score, above which gene is fitted.
