Jax installation on windows is not straightforward.
See:
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/qnqdy0/jax_on_windows/

Basically download correct file (correct python / cuda version) of jaxlib. pip install this. Then pip install jax.

Only works with jax version 0.3.2 on windows i.e.
Download jaxlib-0.3.2-cp38-none-win_amd64.whl from here:
https://whls.blob.core.windows.net/unstable/index.html
Then save in ISS folder.

Then in terminal, run:
pip install jaxlib-0.3.2-cp38-none-win_amd64.whl
pip install jax==0.3.2


On Mac, just pip install jax
